On This Day
===========

This is a [Guardian Hack Day](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/live/2015/feb/26/guardian-hack-day-february-2015-liveblog)
project based on the [Content API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/explore/) and the
[Discussion API](http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api) that will display 10
articles with the most comments for a particular day.

By default, [today](http://onthisday-theguardian.herokuapp.com)'s articles will be displayed
based on published articles and comments so far. For previous days, use a path format of
`/YYYY/MM/DD`. For example, for articles on "Thursday 7 July 2011" go to path
[/2011/07/07](http://onthisday-theguardian.herokuapp.com/2011/07/07)

**Note: The Content API only started indexing comments in late 1998 and the current Discussion
platform started in early 2006 so results will be unreliable before 2006 and unavailable before
1998.**
